## Data

I obtained the raw dialogues from [Genius.com](https://genius.com/artists/Game-of-thrones), these were trancribed by volunteers, so not all
seasons are there and of course you will found some mistakes, but is the best there is. Also I encourage you to participate and transcribe some dialogues yourself, it will be so cool to have all the seasons transcribed for further analysis. 

All the csv files I will use are available [here](https://github.com/chrismartinezb/Game-of-thrones-analysis/tree/master/CSV), and you can find how I transform the raw text into a more useful csv in the [Final Pipeline](https://github.com/chrismartinezb/Game-of-thrones-analysis/blob/master/Final%20Pipeline.ipynb) notebook.
